The world is the planet Earth and all life on it, including human civilization.
[1] In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical Universe,
or an ontological world (the "world" of an individual). In a theological context,
the world is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial,
spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "End of the world" scenarios refer to
the end of human history, often in religious contexts.
