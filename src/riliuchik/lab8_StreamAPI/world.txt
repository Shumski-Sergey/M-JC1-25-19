In Christianity, the term often connotes the concept of the fallen and corrupt world order of human society,
in contrast to the World to Come. The world is frequently cited alongside the flesh and the Devil
as a source of temptation that Christians should flee. Monks speak of striving to be "in this world,
but not of this world"—as Jesus said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood",
the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.
